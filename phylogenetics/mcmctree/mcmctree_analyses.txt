*not a script*

### PRIOR TO ANALYSIS ###
Use sequence file (same as used for iqtree analyses) and output treefile from iqtree analyses to set a calibration node

Used provided R script to set uniform calibration node at appropriate age (see manuscript)

### STEP 1 ###
Run control file with usedata argument set to 0

### STEP 2 ###
Run control file with usedata argument set to 3 (easiest to just do this with a text editor, otherwise you need to make 3 different control files in advance with this adjustment)

Change name of "out.BV" file to "in.BV"

### STEP 3 ###
Run control file with usedata argument set to "usedata=2 in.BV"

### STEP 4 ###
Repeat step 3.

### STEP 5 ###
Assess convergence:

1) Input mcmc.txt files into Tracer to check ESS values at each node are over 200.

2) Check to see if average estimates at each node match between two runs.
